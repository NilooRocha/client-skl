# My First React Native APP ðŸ“±

Explore my journey of building my first React Native application, where I leverage my existing skills in React and Tailwind CSS to create a mobile experience focused on authentication and profile switching.

## Project Overview

This project marks my first venture into the world of React Native development. Drawing from my experience with React and Tailwind CSS in Next.js, I aimed to build a functional mobile app centered around authentication and profile management. The goal was to apply my existing knowledge while navigating the unique challenges of mobile development.

## Why React Native & Tailwind?

Having worked extensively with React and Tailwind CSS in Next.js projects, I chose React Native to leverage my existing skillset and speed up the development process. React Native's cross-platform capabilities allow me to reuse my CSS skills through Nativewind, making styling easier and more efficient.

## Project Structure: Organization & Decisions

The project follows a modular structure to ensure maintainability and scalability. Here's an overview of the key directories:

```

### Key Directories

- **`api`**: Centralized API request functions to improve code organization and reusability.
- **`components`**: Reusable UI elements, following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- **`context`**: Manages global state, providing app-wide access to data.
- **`hooks`**: Custom React hooks that encapsulate logic used across components.
- **`types`**: TypeScript type definitions for better type safety.

## Key Learnings

- **State Management**: Gaining a deeper understanding of how to effectively manage app state.
- **React Native Components**: Mastering the core components and their properties.
- **Nativewind**: Utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling React Native components.

## React/Next.js to React Native: Challenges & Solutions

Transitioning from React/Next.js to React Native came with a few challenges:

- **UI Components**: Adapting to React Native's components, which differ significantly from traditional HTML elements.
- **Styling**: Learning how to apply styles effectively using Nativewind.
- **Platform Differences**: Handling the differences between iOS and Android platforms.
- **Navigation**: Implementing navigation between screens.
